  Demonstrated ability to design and implement features in existing and new products
  Adept at writing well-structured and easily maintainable code using C, C++, Java, PHP, HTML etc. etc.
  Well versed in providing detailed feedback on documentation and test plans for features
  Great logical, debugging and reasoning skills
  Passion for providing quality solutions

As a proactive and enthusiastic individual, I would welcome an opportunity to discuss my software engineering capabilities with you. If you require any additional information, I can be reached at (408) 724-7886 or via email at navit.gaur@sjsu.edu.
